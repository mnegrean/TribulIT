# TribulIT (IT tribe)
TribulIT code samples.

**Update**: 

This used to be the repository where I uploaded the code samples for tribulit. Tribulit aimed to be an IT blog for the Romanian community but I was not able to maintain it and decided to drop it. I didn't want to keep it because personally I don't like a blog that it's dead. 

However, in order to pay my respects for what tribulit once used to be (maybe it wasn't the largest blog, or maybe it wasn't even large, or a blog, but it was mine), I will post a few articles under the wiki pages.
